# rlDiceGame
implementation of q learning on a simplified version of a chinese drinking game, similar to german game "bluff" (f x schmid 1993)

In a future version I will upload a pickled player object, which has pre-trained Q-mqtrices. I still have to find a way to minimize its size and evaluate its performance manually.

this was one of my first projects and as such looks terrible. i broke naming conventions and didn't use many comments.
if you want to test this out i'd recommend you wait for a future release, but i'd be happy if you roast me with some useful advice in between.
