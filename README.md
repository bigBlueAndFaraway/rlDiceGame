# rlDiceGame
implementation of q learning on a simplified version of a chinese drinking game, similar to german game "bluff" (f x schmid 1993)

currently dysfunctional. q matrices don't update, most likely since i chose to implement them with OOP so they're attributes instead of standalone arrays.
will fix that when i find some time.

also full disclaimer: this was one of my first projects and as such looks terrible. i broke naming conventions and didn't use many comments.
if you want to test this out i'd recommend you wait for a future release.
